# Level 2 Game Development
By Kael Robertson.

Made with Godot 3.5.

All relevant code is located within the 'scripts' folder.

An output file 'output.txt' is created once the player gets either of the endings.
This is located in the root directory of the exported game, but an example can also be seen here in the repository.
